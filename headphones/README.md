#Project HeadPhones Website

For this project, I will be implementing from scratch a fully responsive website inspired by UI/UX designer Nicholas Phillippot. (Kindly find the link attached below).
The website will be entirely made of CSS and HTML excluding external CSS framework and Javascript

#Features:
*Fully responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile version activates at 480 px and below).
*Interactive elements with hover and active state effects (links turn #FF6565 on hover/active, buttons have a 0.9 opacity on hover/active).
*Content area with a maximum width of 1000px centered on the page

**Project Structure:**

*'index.html': Main HTML file for website
*'styles.css': Main CSS file for styling
*'assets': Folder for any additional resources (images, fonts, etc.)

**Note:** This is a basic example, and the actual implementation might involve additional files and functionalities
